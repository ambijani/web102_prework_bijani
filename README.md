## Notes

1. Formatting the Website
Formatting the website and ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout presented a challenge. Balancing the design elements, such as colors, fonts, and spacing, required attention to detail. The challenge involved experimenting with CSS styles to achieve the desired look while maintaining responsiveness across different devices.

2. Working with JavaScript
Understanding and implementing JavaScript concepts posed challenges, especially when dealing with conditional statements like ternary operators. Figuring out the correct syntax for ternary operators to dynamically display content based on certain conditions required careful consideration. Additionally, working with event listeners and DOM manipulation introduced complexities that were addressed through trial and error.

3. Destructuring and Spread Operator
Implementing destructuring and the spread operator in JavaScript, especially when extracting and displaying information about the top two funded games, involved a learning curve. Deciphering the correct usage of these operators and integrating them into the code to enhance readability and efficiency required thorough understanding.
